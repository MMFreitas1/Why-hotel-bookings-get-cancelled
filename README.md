# Why-Hotel-Bookings-Get-Cancelled
A Hotel business wants to know if their data hides some hints that can answer the question: how can we reduce the number of cancelations?

__Quote__:
"You are supporting a hotel with a project aimed to increase revenue from their room bookings. They believe that they can use data science to help them reduce the number of cancellations. This is where you come in! They have asked you to use any appropriate methodology to identify what contributes to whether a booking will be fulfilled or cancelled. They intend to use the results of your work to reduce the chance someone cancels their booking.

Your challenge

Create a report that covers the following:

What factors affect whether customers cancel their booking?
Are cancellations more likely during weekends?
Which general recommendations for the hotel can you make?"
